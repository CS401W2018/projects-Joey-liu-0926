    <h2>1.What is the difference between block tags and inline tags.</h2>
    <p>Block Tags:
        Take up the entire width of the parent container, meaning they start on a new line and push the following content down.
        They generally form larger structure elements like paragraphs or divisions.</p>
    <p>Inline Tags:
        only take up the necessary width to fit their content, and they don't force other content onto new lines.
        Typically used for smaller pieces of content within a block element.</p>
    <h2>2.What is the margin, border, and padding?</h2>
    <p>Margin:
        The outer space between the element's border and surrounding elements.
        Used to control the spacing outside an element.</p>
    <p>Border:
        The line or edge surrounding the element's padding and content.
        Borders can have various styles (solid, dashed, etc.), colors, and thicknesses.</p>
    <p>Padding:
        The inner space between the element's content and its border.
        Used to create space inside the element, between the content and the border.</p>
    <h2>3.What are units of measurement you can use in CSS?</h2>

    <h2>4.When would you use a figure tag?</h2>
