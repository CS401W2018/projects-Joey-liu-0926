    <h2>What is the difference between a block and an inline tag? Give examples of each one.</h2>
    <p>Block-level elements take up the full width available and start on a new line. They create a "block" of content.</p>
    <p>Inline elements do not start on a new line; they only take up as much width as necessary. They allow content to flow within the same line as other elements.</p>
    <h2>What is normal flow in HTML?</h2>
    <p>Normal Flow refers to the default layout of elements in an HTML document. In normal flow, block-level elements stack vertically from top to bottom, while inline elements sit within block-level elements and flow horizontally from left to right.</p>
    <h2>What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?</h2>
    <p>The 'float' property in CSS allows an element to be taken out of the normal flow of the document and positioned to the left or right of its container. Other content can then wrap around it.</p>
    <p>When elements are floated, they are removed from the normal flow, which can cause parent containers to collapse (having zero height). To prevent this, you can use the clear property on subsequent elements to ensure that they do not wrap around floated elements. Clearing the float restores the normal flow for those elements.</p>
    <h2>What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?</h2>
    <p>Relative Positioning (position: relative): The element is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow. This means that you can move it from where it would normally be, but it still occupies its original space in the layout.</p>
    <p>Absolute Positioning (position: absolute): The element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the nearest parent element that has a position of relative, absolute, or fixed). If there is no such ancestor, it will be positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the viewport). It does not occupy space in the normal flow.</p>
    <p>Fixed Positioning (position: fixed): The element is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it will stay in the same place even when the page is scrolled. It does not occupy space in the normal flow.</p>
