        <h3>1.who is Jay Chou?</h3>
        <p>Jay Chou is a very popular musician in China, not because of his appearance, but because he's talent on music. He's music is always inspiried and meaningful, his lyrics are also always being relatable.</p>
        <h3>2. What kind of songs he has wrote?</h3>
        <p>He has lots of songs about family, like songs about listen to your mom's words, the childhood memory, and so on.But one of my favorite song from him is called "Dao Xiang" which taught me never give up.</p>
        <p>And here's the lyrics I really like:</p>
        <p>
        "If you have too many complaints about this world,
        <br>
        You stumble and don't dare to keep moving forward.
        <br>
        Why are people so fragile and ready to fall?
        <br>
        Please turn on the TV and look,
        <br>
        How many people are fighting for life, bravely moving forward.
        <br>
        Shouldn't we be content,
        <br>
        Cherish everything, even if we don't own it?"
