    <h1>Hello,my name is Joey Liu</h1>
    <h2>Brief introduction about myself:</h2>
    <p>I from China, this is my third semester in BYU-Hawaii, many people asked me why did I choose to come to Hawaii, it just because I consider Hawaii as one of my favorite place in the world that I want to visit, and I have loved every single day since I'm here, and something I like to do here are:</p>
    <ol type = "A">
        <li>watch the sunrise</li>
        <li>shopping in the town</li>
        <li>go to pcc</li>
    </ol>
    <P>I served my mission in England last year, and I think that was my highlight of my whole life, because I learned so much from my daily missionary life, members and families around me, and especially the great mission leaders, I still remember the great lesson I learned from my mission President is that he told us:</P>
    <blockquote>"Faith is believing that the sun will rise"</blockquote>
    <p>I think it's not only helped me increas my faith in the Lord while I was on the mission, but also helped me while I'm school here to always remember what I'm supposed to do.</p>
